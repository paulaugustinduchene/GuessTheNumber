# GuessTheNumber
This is a guessing game where the computer generates a random number and the user has to guess what that number is. The function evaluates() checks if the user's guess is higher or lower than the actual number, and the function validate_price() makes sure that the user's input is a valid number. If the user's guess is correct, the program prints "You won!!!!" and exits.
